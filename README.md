# react-vtt

A React component for displaying WebVTT tracks.

## Install

```bash
bower install react-vtt
```

## Usage

All you need is the `<Cue />` and a proper CSS.

Please check `src/main.ls` line 11 and line 25 before I write examples in JSX.

## ToDo

* [ ] move main.ls to `/examples`
* [ ] build and publish to gh-pages with Travis-CI
* [ ] port livescript component to ES6
  * [ ] Cue
  * [ ] ReactVTT
